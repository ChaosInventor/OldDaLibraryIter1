# DaLibrary first iteration

This is the first iteration of DaLibrary, a project that would later turn into
[DaLanguage](https://github.com/ChaosInventor/DaLanguage). This project was
supposed to be a general purpose library for C++ with a focus on flexibility.
Due to various reasons, I saw it as a failure in its goals and decided to work
on the [next iteration](https://github.com/ChaosInventor/OldDaLibraryIter2),
taking all I had learnt and hopefully building something better.

This is an archive, I will not develop this project further.
